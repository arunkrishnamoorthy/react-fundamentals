# LET and CONST Keyword

`LET` and `CONST` are the different ways of creating variables similar to the `var` keyword which we use traditionally to create variables in `Javascript`.

Before `ES6`, we traditionally use the `var` keyword to create the variables in the javascript.
In the version of `ES6` a new set of variables are introduced namely `LET` and `CONST` and is recommened to use.

### LET

It is safe to say that `LET` is the new `VAR` keyword. The variables that are created using the `LET` keyword is dynamic and the value can be reassigned
anytime within the scope.

### CONST

`CONST` is a keyword that is used to declare variables that are static. That means, the value once assigned to the variable created using `CONST` cannot
be re-assigned later in the program.

Throughout the course of these react-fundamentals we will be using these two keys for declaring the variables.
